# Glossary

There is only one external documentation glossary for all Cloudflare terms (https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/glossary). Any terms should be added to this glossary as a glossary entry.

Adding a glossary entry should be done with input from the team to ensure consensus on use of a term and/or its definition.
