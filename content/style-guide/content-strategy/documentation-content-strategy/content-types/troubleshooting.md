### Additional information

There are multiple content types that answer questions/provide solutions in Cloudflare documentation: FAQ, Troubleshooting (this page), and Support (in-work). See Should this be an FAQ, Troubleshooting, or Support section? for help deciding which type of content to create.

In general, create a unique Troubleshooting section for your product. If the Troubleshooting steps are minimal, include the guidance on one Troubleshooting page. If there are several Troubleshooting steps, create separate pages for logical groupings of Troubleshooting.
