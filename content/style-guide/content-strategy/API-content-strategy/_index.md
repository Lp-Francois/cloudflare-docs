# API content strategy

The API content strategy aims to:

+ Reduce internal and external user frustration.
+ Align with industry standards in terms of naming conventions and descriptions.
+ Create world-class content that is just as good, or better, than very popular API documentation.

Our API docs should be straightforward, easy to navigate, and consistent.

By ensuring Cloudflare's API content is straightforward, easy to navigate, and consistent, we can create world-class API content that eliminates user frustration and serves as an example of good API documentation.
